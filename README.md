## Twitch Setup

* Be sure you have `Non-Mod Chat Delay` turned off in your hosts moderation settings.
* If you're using more than 1 account be sure `Followers-only mode` is turned off in your hosts moderation settings.
* Depending on how you set up your bot system, be sure that `Email Verification` is turned off in your hosts moderation settings.


    It seems like this should work using the same bot codes and random users, but that doesn't seem to be the case.
